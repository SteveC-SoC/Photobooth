# Photobooth

## Idea

Create a photobooth that works without mouse or keybord input

### How to run

Clone the code down from GitHub, run "npm i" in the command line (to get the node modules), then run "npm start" in the command line.

Say Cheese!!! 😁

### Issues

- taking multiple pictures, as it recognises "cheese" three times
